#### Request Body



#

**Note:** You can enable multiple payment methods (e.g. `card`, `klarna`, `ideal`) depending on your Stripe account's eligibility. If you omit `payment_method_types`, Stripe will choose based on customer geography and session settings.

---

### `POST /webhook`

Stripe will send events here (e.g. `checkout.session.completed`). You must:

1. Set up your webhook URL in the Stripe Dashboard or using Stripe CLI.
2. Proxy `localhost:8000/webhook` via ngrok or similar:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```


### `GET /success?session_id=...`

Displays success page after payment.

---

### `GET /cancel`

Displays cancel page when checkout is abandoned.



* This version stores orders **in-memory**; you'll lose them on restart.
* Avoid hardcoding secrets.
* Stripe Checkout UI will auto-detect applicable payment methods depending on:

  * Customer's country
  * Your account's enabled payment methods
  * Currency compatibility
